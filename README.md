Always wanted to create something to make a task that I perform 10 times a day a little more efficient. How many times has it happened to you that you were looking for some information, you'd open multiple article links in different tabs, understand it roughly and then go to youtube to get it properly?

This website does it all in one place. It takes the user query and gets the top 3 articles from Google, summarizes them, and shows them in a not-so-bad designed card. It also recommends top Youtube videos.

Proved somewhat helpful so long, hope to hear feedback from all of you to improve it and make searching the web productive.
